;; REVIEW: The line and bezier here are not very reusable. They're a royal pain
;; to manipulate via affine transformations. Path segments are manipulated by
;; their boundaries, not as shapes in the plane.
;;
;; Maybe there's a fundamental distinction to be made between path segments and
;; everything else?
